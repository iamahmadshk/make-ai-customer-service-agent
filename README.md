# Make.com Customer Service Agent Workflow

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a **Make.com automation workflow** that integrates:  
- Google Forms (for collecting customer queries)  
- Make AI Agents (for intelligent automated responses)  

The workflow watches for new Google Form responses, then passes the input to a **custom AI Agent** which generates a meaningful reply or action automatically.

## ⚙️ Tools & Services Used
- **Make.com** – Automation platform  
- **Google Forms** – To capture customer responses  
- **Make AI Agents** – To process the response and provide intelligent output  

## 🛠️ Workflow Steps

2. Reconnect your own Google Forms and Make AI Agent connections.  
3. Replace placeholder values (`YOUR_FORMID_HERE`, `YOUR_AGENT_HERE`, etc.) with your actual IDs.  
4. Run the scenario to test the automation.
